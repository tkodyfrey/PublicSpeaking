# Historical Overview

## The Influence of Speech Communication {.smaller}

-   The basic course ... is perhaps the original and most enduring pedagogical element in the communication discipline (Valenzano et al., 2014)
-   National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) -\> National Association of Academic Teachers of Public Speaking (NAATPS) -\> National Communication Association (NCA)
-   Research concerning oral performance, bodily gestures, and imitation of great speakers began to take on the agenda of a social science discipline
    -   Led to the rise of empirically oriented communication programs

## Critiquing Speech {.smaller}

-   The legacy of speech communication leaves communication uniquely qualified to improve speaking skills across the total educational landscape
-   However, the study of speech is not sufficiently rooted in the theoretical traditions of the modern discipline
    -   Communication as a field is far more complex - theoretically and methodologically - than what is taught in traditional speech classes

## The 'Basic' Course as the Front Porch {.smaller}

-   Beebe (2008) referred to the 'basic' course as the "front porch," welcoming new students to the Communication discipline
-   The front porch creates a good first impression, but ultimately looks nothing like what you’ll find inside (the theoretical depth of the discipline)
-   Seen as too skills-focused and lacking the theory that defines the broader field
-   Public speaking scholars are sometimes relegated to the margins, as no one "lives" on the porch

## Public Speaking as a Foundation {.smaller}

-   Can we rethink the public speaking course as the foundation of the house? 
    -   It is strong, stable, and holds everything up
-   Public speaking as an area of practice belongs to everyone.
-   By teaching the theory behind why students take certain actions and value certain ways of speaking (in addition to skills), the public speaking course can directly support the "house"

# Teaching Philosophy

## Core Belief

*The classroom is not an isolated context.*

The lessons, ideas, and opinions shared during instruction are not confined to these spaces but are reflections of a larger society that shapes one’s lived experiences

## Reflection {.smaller}

-   Rooted in Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)
-   Students use extensive reflection to internalize content relative to their own perspectives, beliefs, and values
-   Manifests as opportunities to lead discussions, share thoughts, free write about lessons, self-reflect, or express viewpoints
-   The instructor has a responsibility to facilitate this reflection

## Flexibility {.smaller}

-   Instructors must remain flexible in their practice
-   Involves giving students voice to adapt pedagogy appropriately
-   Determine effective methods for teaching via:
    -   Instructor-student relationships
    -   Sound assessments that produce appropriate feedback
    -   Pedagogical content knowledge that stems from research and practice

## Clarity {.smaller}

-   Clarity is the foundational principle that enables student learning
-   Clarity must encompass *content* and *procedure*
    -   Content: pedagogy should intentionally and deliberately reduce uncertainty about what students will learn and how they will be assessed
    -   Procedure: instructors must balance authority and rapport by having rules and policies in place that (1) create conditions suitable for learning and (2) establish a standard for treating students fairly

## Holistic Student Support {.smaller}

-   I believe in *Humans first, Students second*
-   How can we show all students that they are valued? How can we promote fairness for all students?
    -   Use sound communication behaviors to create safe spaces and climates.
    -   Consider accessibility of all course materials
    -   Incorporate a diverse selection of content (e.g., textbooks, podcasts, videos)

# Course Philosophy

Principles of a Successful Public Speaking Course

## Ongoing Assessment {.smaller}

-   Must understand *constituents* vs *constraints*
-   Ongoing assessment allows us to showcase course performance and target areas for intervention
    -   Assessment can also be an important research endeavor
-   Assessment also leads to enhanced advocacy

## Clarity {.smaller}

-   Multiple sections with multiple instructors requires clarity in both content and procedure
-   Want instructors to have freedom to decide day to day endeavors
    -   Need consistency to conduct proper assessment
    -   Need consistency to deal with problems effectively
-   Enough clarity so all instructors are prepared to teach content and all students are prepared to learn

## Uncertainty Reduction {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Should rely on concrete *Models of Expected Performance*
-   The models exemplify sound criteria so students know what to expect
-   Can train students to identify desired behaviors
:::

## Socialization {.smaller}

-   Success is a community endeavor
-   Everyone should work for each other, not necessarily for the director
    -   Strong community will enhance course buy-in
-   The community, as well as the class, should be a positive climate
-   How do we stay connected to each other but remain respectful of time as well?

## Feedback {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Assessment needs to be based in sound criteria
-   Feedback should facilitate skill development
-   Rubrics should be comprehensive
-   Students should be trained how to use them

# Course Vision

Making sure students prefer what we do

## A Disciplinary Foundation

::: {.r-fit-text}
Goal is to show that communication goes beyond oration while still meeting course objectives

1.  Better incorporate data and analysis in speech development (speaking as an applied endeavor)
2.  Better integration of various theoretical lenses
3.  Focused speech topics on interpersonal, intercultural, organizational, or health messaging
4.  Ground technique in theory and not just as tips for success
5.  Partner across the field to show that communication is vast
6.  Speech Mechanics -> Speech Ethics (How do norms reflect power structures?)
7.  Others?
:::

## World Class Teacher Training {.smaller}

-   I believe we should:
    -   Prepare good teachers at all levels
    -   Make skill development ongoing

::: panel-tabset
### Instructional Discussion

-   A specific teaching strategy characterized by high student interaction, the use of students' personal experience, and higher order questioning
-   Less interested in what we say as instructors and more in helping students reach logical conclusions
-   Includes planning, facilitating, and evaluating

### Experiential Activities

-   There should be a structure to the activities we use in our classes
-   Experience, Describe, Infer, Transfer (EDIT)

### Ongoing PD

-   We want all instructors to be the best versions of themselves
-   Professional development should be the responsibility of everyone
-   Envision various opportunities for everyone involved to share their knowledge through professional development series
:::

## Public Speaking Center / TOPS Expansion {.smaller}

-   Expand Center so it is designed to meet needs of everyone on campus
-   Ensure that those who use Center see communication as beyond public speaking
-   An expansion would be:
    -   Rooted in communication research
    -   Based in a consulting relationship where we determine how to best help
    -   Use assessment data to determine how to address needs
    
Nyquist, J. D., Wulff, D. H., & Abbott, R. D. (1989). The interface between communication and instruction: Communication foundations for a university instructional development center. *Communication Education*, *38*, 377-386. https://doi.org/10.1080/03634528909378779

## Relentless Advocacy {.smaller}

-   Given that others want to teach public speaking, we need solidify ourselves as its champion
    -   Who else is more qualified?
    -   See Basic Communication Course Annual Volume 18
-   Ongoing assessment allows us to showcase how well our students are doing and retain enrollment
-   Sustained representation on Volunteer Core
-   Promotion of course on local, state, and national level


## Procedural Clarity {.smaller}

-   Instructors must understand what to do when they encounter problems
-   I believe there should be a systematic process for a variety of circumstances
    -   If plagiarism is suspected, instructors should...
    -   If GenAI is being used inappropriately, instructors should...
    -   If a student is misbehaving, instructors should...

## Generative AI

::: {.r-fit-text}
"*The University embraces the use of AI as a powerful tool for the purpose of enhancing human learning, creativity, analysis, and innovation within the academic context.*"

-   Gen AI needs to be embraced in responsible and ethical ways
-   The communication course is site for development and learning and not for jeopardizing academic success
    -   Students cannot fail trying
-   We can uniquely teach students how to use it responsibly in the context of building speeches

::: notes
Expanding focus of course to benefit specific needs (e.g., technical communication)
Community partnerships / service learning
Textbooks
Haven't even mentioned business class yet
Virtual Reality and new technologies

# Leadership / Administrative Philosophy

## Capability for Self Reflection {.smaller}

Every good leader needs to possess a capability for self-reflection; they should be able to reflect on their successes and failures in order to grow, adapt, and meet the needs of their followers

## Situational Leadership {.smaller}

-   Requires one to intimately know and assess their followers
-   A good leader needs to be aware of these situations so that they may intervene, guide, or coach followers appropriately
-   I can be available frequently or not at all, depending on one's needs

## Followership {.smaller}

-   Leadership is co-created with followers
-   Effective leaders are grounded in the relationships and connections they have with those they seek to influence
-   We can build self-concept and buy-in by giving everyone a voice

## Charismatic Leadership {.smaller}

-   Leadership is a performance that requires charisma to motivate followers
-   I strongly believe in: 
    -   my personal approach public speaking pedagogy
    -   identifying models of expected performance
    -   managing the classroom
    -   addressing challenge behaviors
    -   providing high-quality feedback
-   Charismatic leaders sell their vision to followers, but they also need to articulate that vision to those within the university who seek to constrain what they create
